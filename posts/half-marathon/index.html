    <h1 class="title">Half Marathon</h1>
    
    <div class="content">
      <p>I ran my first half-marathon yesterday!!</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s been a goal of mine for a while. I had hoped to get there sometime this summer, but this works too. It wasn&rsquo;t an actual race, just a normal run around campus.</p>
<h2 id="the-run">The Run</h2>
<p>On Saturday (March 4th) I went for a longer run after work, it felt great, so I set a tentative goal to run 11 miles on Wednesday. It&rsquo;s been about 4 weeks since a ran 10, and my daily runs have been a lot longer the past couple weeks. So, it seemed reasonable to push my personal best.</p>
<p>Yesterday (March 6th) I set out to run a bit further than usual, in order to prepare for the longer run Wednesday. It turned out to be a perfect day for a run, a little chilly, but not enough to be uncomfortable, and the sun was shining. I ran the usual route through Historic St. Mary&rsquo;s City, past the visitor&rsquo;s center and onto the trail loop. From my dorm to the trails is about 2 miles, and the loop is roughly 3. I typically run about 5 to 10 minutes into the woods, then turn around for my daily runs. For longer runs, like yesterday, I&rsquo;ll do the whole loop.</p>
<p>My shoelace was loose, so I stopped tie it before getting into the woods. Then roughly 3 steps past the trail head I dropped an earbud taking off my jacket. I was a little bit peeved having to stop twice, but my time recovered, eventually.</p>
<p>After running a quarter of the trail I was feeling great. It was so, so relaxing running through the woods, and I didn&rsquo;t feel tired at all. Why not do an extra lap? Maybe I could even get to 11 miles today instead of Wednesday. That got me thinking: What if I ran third? An extra loop would bring me to a 13 miles total, after running back to the dorm. I thought about on it for a bit. Mostly I thought about how great it would be if I could actually do it. I&rsquo;d tried to work my way up to a half-marathon about year ago, but didn&rsquo;t make it. I could just check it off the list now. Why not? I was feeling great, it seemed like as good time as any.</p>
<p>The rest of that loop was fantastic, but the second was more difficult. I definitely didn&rsquo;t drink enough water ahead of time. By the time I started on the third I definitely wasn&rsquo;t feeling great physically. My feet were achy, I had a stitch in my side and my mouth was really, really dry; But, I was also over half way there! Plus, I was still having a good time. I still had room to think, and I was enjoying the conversation on <a href="https://headgum.com/high-and-mighty/344-matrix-trilogy-w-actionboyz">High and Mighty</a>. After I completed the last loop my watch read something around 11.75 miles. Since the run back to my dorm was almost exactly 2, I ran a quarter mile into the woods before turning around.</p>
<p>Once I turned around every ailment mention cleared up. It felt almost like I had just started the run. I ran the last mile and a half at least a minute faster than any other mile. I was so excited when I finally stopped.</p>
<h2 id="reflection">Reflection</h2>
<p>I&rsquo;m trilled just to have run the distance, it was a big leap from next best, <a href="/posts/10mi">10 miles</a>. Although, I do want to work on the time. I ran 13.24 miles in 2:07:36, so my pace was 9'38&quot;/mi. All the times for miles 3 to 11 were hovering somewhere around 9'30&quot; to 10'00&quot; per mile, with the majority somewhere in 9'45&quot; to 10' range. Part of the reason for the slower pace was because those were the miles on the trail. The trails in Historic St. Mary&rsquo;s aren&rsquo;t particularly technical, but I&rsquo;ve noticed I consistently run a bit slower on them, even on shorter runs. Still, I&rsquo;d love to bring those mile times down to 9'30&quot;. Next goal is to get my time under 2 hours. Eventually.</p>
<p>Thanks for reading! :)</p>
