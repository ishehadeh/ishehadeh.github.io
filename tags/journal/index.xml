      <description>I ran 10 miles today!
My previous record was 9mi, from about a year ago. That run was from the half-marathon training which I quit, right after. Getting up to that distance again felt amazing.
I&amp;rsquo;m still hoping to run a half-marathon some day. Though I don&amp;rsquo;t want to push it. For the time being I&amp;rsquo;ll just run when I feel like it, for whatever distance I can. This &amp;ldquo;plan&amp;rdquo; has been working much better than my training plan did last year.</description>
